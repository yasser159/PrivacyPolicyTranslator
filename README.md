# PrivacyPolicyTranslator

This MacOS application serves as a client for the Google Translate API, requiring users to possess a Google Cloud API Key in order to utilize it. The software offers translation capabilities for HTML documents, spanning from English to French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Turkish, Arabic, Hindi, Russian, and Hebrew.

For developers seeking to deploy multilingual applications and necessitating automatic translation of their privacy policies into any of the aforementioned languages simultaneously while maintaining its HTML format, this application will prove valuable. Users need not concern themselves with HTML tags, as the translator will disregard them.

The software functions by accepting HTML files or regular text as input, and returns fully functional translated HTML files as output. These translated  files are then prepared for immediate upload onto the privacy policy website.
